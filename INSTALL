STONEAGE -- Build and install instructions


1. QUICK INSTALLATION of distributed tarballs
---------------------------------------------

    tar -xcf stoneage-x.y.z.tar.gz
    cd stoneage-x.y.z
    ./configure
    make
    make install


2. Build from Subversion
------------------------

This requires GNU autotools installed with autoconf >= 2.6 and automake
>= 1.1.

It also requires the tool "xcf2png" from the "xcftools" package to
extract layers from a Gimp xcf file to png format.

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make

3. Custom ./configure options
-----------------------------

--enable-debugging

    Builds with compiler flags "-O0 -g3" for debugging the result with
    gdb.

--enable-resbuild

    Attempts to re-create the game's resourcefiles even if they are
    already there. Don't use this with distributed tarballs, as they
    don't contain the files the resources are created from.

4. Custom make tagets
---------------------

make maintainer-clean

    This automake rule is extended, so it also removes any generated
    *.in files as well as the ./configure script.

make vcs-clean

    Does a maintainer-clean and removes any other generated files, so
    the directory tree should only contain files suitable for placing in
    the VCS repository. This includes the doxy directory with the
    doxygen-generated documentation as well as the game resource files
    (*.sar)

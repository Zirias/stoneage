STONEAGE -- created after a roughly boulderdash-like AmigaBASIC game

This is currently non-functional pre-alpha software, so a detailed
description will follow later.


VERSIONING SCHEME:

n.m.x: alpha/beta version aimed at minor release version n.(m+1).0

n.x.0: minor release version

x.0.0: major version x.

DEVELOPMENT POLICIES:

1) SCM:

- use GNU autotools.

- keep any autotools-generated files out of the VCS.

- The only place to configure the version number is the VERSION file.

2) Coding:

- Strictly stick to ANSI C89/C90 standards.

- Use GCC -pedantic-errors, -Wall and -Werror flags to check the code.
  Whenever GCC thinks something in the code is not clear (like, e.g.,
  having a switch statement that only handles some possible enum values
  and does not have a default: branch), add the "redundant" code (like
  in this case, a "default: ;") to make the intention clear. The
  compiler will optimize it away.

- use doxygen to document AT LEAST the header files.

- make use of goto! But ONLY in one special case where a function/method
  needs some "cleanup" code for multiple execution paths. Instead of
  repeating that code everywhere, place it at the end of the function,
  set a label "<functionname>_done:" and use goto.

- keep code to the left whereever possible. So instead of writing
  something like
    if (condition)
    {
      ...;
    }
  better write
    if (!condition) return;
    ...;
  The "goto" rule can also help with that.

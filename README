STONEAGE -- created after a roghly boulderdash-like AmigaBASIC game

This is currently non-functional pre-alpha software, so a detailed
description will follow later.


VERSIONING SCHEME:

n.m.x: alpha/beta version aimed at minor release version n.(m+1).0

n.x.0: minor release version

x.0.0: major version x.

SCM-POLICIES:

- use GNU autotools
- keep any autotools-generated files out of the VCS
- use doxygen to document AT LEAST the header files
- The only place to configure the version number is the VERSION file
